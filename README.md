# LRU-Cache
An LRU Cache is an ADT that has limited capacity and will discard the least recently used item when in need of storage space. 
Using C, I implemented an LRU Cache using a combination of a set ADT and a hashtable ADT. The LRU cache has functionality such as: insert, find, print, iterate and delete. Only three items are allowed in the cache before the least recently used item is removed.

A makefile is used to compile all the necessary files involved.
